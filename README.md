## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Install Node.js 18.x or later
   ```bash
   # Check your Node.js version
   node --version
   
   # If you need to install or update Node.js, visit https://nodejs.org/
   ```

2. **Package Manager**: This project uses pnpm
   ```bash
   # Install pnpm if you haven't already
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crd-visualize.git
   cd crd-visualize
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Configuration

The application can be configured through environment variables or the configuration file:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url
   ```

### Basic Usage

1. **Connect to a Cluster**:
   - Use the cluster selector in the top navigation to choose your Kubernetes cluster
   - Or use mock mode for testing without a live cluster

2. **Browse CRDs**:
   - Navigate to the CRD browser to see all available Custom Resource Definitions
   - Use the search functionality to filter CRDs
   - Click on any CRD to view its details and relationships

3. **Visualize Relationships**:
   - Switch to the Graph View to see CRD relationships
   - Drag nodes to rearrange the visualization
   - Zoom in/out to focus on specific areas

4. **Export Resources**:
   - Select resources you want to export
   - Click the Download button to get YAML files
